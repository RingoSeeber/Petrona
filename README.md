## Description 

Petrona has evolved to offer a comprehensive range of weights, corresponding italics, an extended set of glyphs to cover 200+ languages. It is also available as a Variable Font. 

This complete version includes a full set of small caps, ligatures, alternates, and all kinds of numerals, fractions, punctuations, symbols, and currencies. It provides all glyphs of level Latin Expert (typefaces that supply everything).

The previous swashy Q is still available, in Stylistic Set 1.

Petronaâ€™s personality is an answer to how many characteristics can be added to a typeface without undermining its purpose within the text-type genre. Petrona playfully maneuvers plenty of personal touches, without losing the essence of a design intended for legibility in digital and print, from headlines to body text. Uppercase with heavy asymmetric serifs and arms of inverted angles combines with lowercase of big x-height, pronounced ascenders, and soft curves of low contrast.

The Petrona project is led by Ringo R. Seeber from Glyph Co, based in Brooklyn, NY.
